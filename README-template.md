## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- React Js
- Tailwind Css
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create a responsive layout using Flexbox. This project also helped me practice my skills in writing clean and maintainable React js and Tailwind Css.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to further improve my understanding of React js and explore more advanced Tailwind Css techniques.
